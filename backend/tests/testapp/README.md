# How to run tests in the backend project

1. Use the command ```pytest```

* without options: will run all tests it can find
* test files need to be named: ```test_*.py``` or ```*_test.py``` to be found by ```pytest```
* Classes which group tests together can also be included in testing. The filename containing the class needs to start with ```Test``` (see *test_demo_class.py*)
